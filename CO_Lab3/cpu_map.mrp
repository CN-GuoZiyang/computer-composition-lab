Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of MUXCYs used:                        92 out of   4,556    2%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:       12,259
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:         2,828 out of  12,259   23%
    Number with an unused LUT:               9,267 out of  12,259   75%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:         164 out of  12,259    1%
    Number of unique control sets:             276
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:               6 out of  18,224    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
